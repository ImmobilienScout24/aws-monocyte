**_Currently under construction._**

**Monocyte is a bot for destroying AWS resources in non-EU regions written in Python using Boto.**
It is especially useful for companies that are bound to European privacy laws and for that reason don't want to process user data in non-EU regions.

The name [Monocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte) is related to a type of white blood cells that are part of a humans innate immune system, the first line of defense being responsible for searching and destroying alien organisms to prevent unwanted infections.
