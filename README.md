**Monocyte - Search and Destroy unwanted AWS Resources relentlessly.**
Monocyte is a bot for destroying AWS resources in non-EU regions written in Python using Boto.
It is especially useful for companies that are bound to European privacy laws and for that reason don't want to process user data in non-EU regions.

The name [Monocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte) is related to a type of white blood cells that are part of a humans innate immune system, the first line of defense being responsible for searching and destroying alien organisms to prevent unwanted infections.
